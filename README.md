Prompting for Creativity â€“ Task 02

ðŸ“Œ About the Task

This repository contains my work for Task 02: Prompting for Creativity as part of my internship with SkillCraft Technology.
The goal of this task is to explore how prompt structure, tone, and examples influence creative outputs in AI models.

I experimented with few-shot prompting and designed prompts to generate outputs such as:

Startup ideas

Story snippets

Ad copies

Creative text samples



---

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand how prompt phrasing impacts creativity.

Compare results generated by different prompt styles (formal, casual, detailed, minimal).

Use few-shot prompting to guide the modelâ€™s persona or tone.

Document findings and analyze which prompts gave the best results.

ðŸ“Š Key Learnings

The structure of a prompt strongly affects detail and depth.

Changing the tone (e.g., professional vs. casual) changes style significantly.

Few-shot prompting improves consistency in output and allows the model to adopt a persona.

Iterative refinement of prompts produces more creative and useful outputs.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Automate prompt testing with OpenAI API.

Add visual comparison charts for outputs.

Explore multi-modal creativity prompts (text + image).

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also prepare Prompts.md and Outputs.md templates** (so you just fill in your actual prompts and results), or only this README is enough for now?
